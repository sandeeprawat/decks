## Project Lifecycle

- ü§ñ Well this deck itself is partially AI Generated
- üìä Let's refer to Github [Commit history](https://github.com/sanrawat_microsoft/llm-poc/commits/main/) 

### Or better yet, let's use AI to generate the project timeline üòä

---

## Project Timeline - Major Milestones
### üöÄ Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
#### Initial Setup and Basic AI Integration

- Project Initialization: Established FastAPI web framework with modular architecture
- Authentication System: Implemented Google OAuth2 authentication with secure session management
- Azure OpenAI Integration: Connected primary AI services with Azure OpenAI for text generation
- Multi-Tab UI Framework: Built Gradio-based interface with 6 distinct tabs (Agent, Image, Voice, Video, Sora Assistant, Settings)

---
### üé® Phase 2: Multimodal AI Capabilities
#### Image and Voice Processing Integration

- Image Generation: Integrated Azure DALL-E 3 for AI image generation with edit capabilities
- Voice Processing: Added bidirectional voice capabilities:
    - Speech-to-text transcription using Azure Speech Services
    - Text-to-speech with advanced SSML support for emotional and multi-language synthesis
- Advanced Voice Features: Implemented 20+ voice options including Indian regional voices
- SSML Template System: Created sophisticated speech markup with emotional controls and pronunciation guides

--- 

### üé¨ Phase 3: Video Generation Revolution
